        <p>Alright so I'm just gonna do the example which explains I could talk about Vim. open/close vim, save files, and more commands. Alright so starting with opening, you'd just want to be in a folder, like in practice, then when your in the pratice folder, you'd want to type "vim " and then after the space whatever you type it would be the name. this would be the name. so like for example, if I type "vim example", then terminal would open vim, naming that vim "example". pretty easy once you practice it. yeah i dont pratice it so im failing this class pretty hard. jokes. anyway, your in the vim right now, so if you want to close the vim, you'd have to press ESC and then ":wq" which closes and saves whatever is in the folder. i dont know how to add a list, unordered list, whatever <pre> / <code> elements are, <kbd> / <samp> is, and like much more. but this is what i have so far. alright peace out gng.  </p>
