## This repo is for a class called GCTAA ITD 110
GCTAA ITD 110 is basically a web design class. Right now I'm just typing random stuff and practicing stuff. Yeah. 

You can find the website to my class at: https://ict.gctaa.net/f25/courses/itd110/index.html

You can find my personal website at: https://jexyytgt.github.io/
