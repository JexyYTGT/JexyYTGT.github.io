## This repo is for a class called GCTAA ITD 110
GCTAA ITD 110 is basically a web design class. Right now I'm just typing random stuff and practicing stuff. Yeah. 

You can find the website to my class at: https://ict.gctaa.net/f25/courses/itd110/index.html

You can find my personal website at: https://jexyytgt.github.io/

I might update this readme file and my website later but for now this is what I have.

what i usually mostly do for this repo is class, but usually at home i'd just mess around with this repo. 

now i do have one question for you:
**What is the most fastest and safest way to make money legally?**

now you might be wondering why im asking such a thing
**Doesn't life revolve around money a lot?**

you've matured if you figured out why
