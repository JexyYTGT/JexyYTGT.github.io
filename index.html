    <p>This website is what I work on and build for GCTAA ITD 110. It is basically a web design class. You can check out what GCTAA ITD 110 is on the link below. It will open a new tab, which is pretty cool.</p>

Alright here's where the real stuff begins.

My name's Prithvi. here's how you pronounce it. say crip, then replace the c with p, which is prip. the th is soft, but not silent. its like a tiny pause with a small sound. i dont know what that is but yeah. 

i used google to make the background black and text white, and also the "external links." 

my friend made a ai for himself, but you can have it here. https://agent-bond-webs.github.io/?authenticated=true

My only academic goal right now is to get at least straight 80% in all my classes. That's the lowest letter B grade you can get. Meaning my GPA would be at least 3, which is good.</p>
