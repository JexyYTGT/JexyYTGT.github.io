    <h1>What's good, yo</h1>

    <p>This website is what I work on and build for GCTAA ITD 110. It is basically a web design class. You can check out what GCTAA ITD 110 is on the link below.</p>

    <a href="https://ict.gctaa.net/f25/courses/itd110/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GCTAA ITD 110 link</a>

    <p>Here's where I upload work for the class. It's a GitHub repository.</p>

    <a href="https://github.com/JexyYTGT/JexyYTGT.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My repo</a>

    <p>My only goal right now is to get at least straight 80% in all my classes. That's the lowest letter B grade you can get. Meaning my GPA would be at least 3, which is good.</p>
